##### what does a media kit contain?

**1.Media Advisory **

a media advisory includes nothing more than the major points that press need to know about your launch and includes any necessary background information on your company and its founders - yes, time to brag (briefly) about you!  It should begin with a strong one (or two) line positioning statement. 	

clearly articularte the problem your company is tackling and a strong argument for the solution you're providing. 

Highlight killer features - especially if you're attempting to differentiate your product from the competition.Give insights into the 'big picture' yet hold enough back to inspire the journalist to want to know more. Indicate milestones you've achieved to date and key developments on the horizon in a bulleted list at the end. Don’t forget to include an embargo date and time if you're coordinating a timed launch.

**2. Logos & Screenshots**

**3. Founder Bios & Photos**

**4. Sell-Sheet or Fact-Sheet (if available)**

Chances are you've prepared a fact sheet for investors or pitches, which would contain information on the market opportunity (potential) and where your product fits into that ecosystem. If you’ve had a chance to prepare one (assuming it positions your company favorably and has strong facts/stats to support that positioning), include it in the media kit too. It’s a great condensed glimpse at your company and product.
